# multistrap merges packages from different repositories to make complete, bootable, root filesystems (rootfs).

# debootstrap depends on nothing but shell, wget, binutils and thus can run pretty-much anywhere
# multistrap uses apt and dpkg directly so can only work on a debian system

# multistrap creates a rootfs which just needs to be mounted (or chrooted) and configured with
#     dpkg --configure -a

$ apt install multistrap

$ multistrap --help
multistrap version 2.2.10
Usage:
 multistrap [-a ARCH] [-d DIR] -f CONFIG_FILE
 multistrap -?|-h|--help|--version

Command:
 -f|--file CONFIG_FILE:  path to the multistrap configuration file.

Options:
 -a|--arch ARCHITECTURE: override the configuration file architecture.
 -d|--dir PATH:          override the configuration file directory.
    --no-auth:           do not use Secure Apt for any repositories
    --tidy-up:           remove apt cache data and downloaded archives.
    --dry-run:           output the configuration and exit
    --simulate:          output the configuration and exit
 -?|-h|--help:           print this usage message and exit
 --version:              print this usage message and exit

multistrap replaces debootstrap to provide support for multiple
repositories, using a configuration file to specify the relevant suites,
architecture, extra packages and the mirror to use for each repository.

Example configuration:
[General]
arch=armel
directory=/opt/multistrap/
# same as --tidy-up option if set to true
cleanup=true
# same as --no-auth option if set to true
# keyring packages listed in each bootstrap will
# still be installed.
noauth=false
# extract all downloaded archives (default is true)
unpack=true
# enable MultiArch for the specified architectures
# default is empty
multiarch=
# aptsources is a list of sections to be used for downloading packages
# and lists and placed in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/multistrap.sources.list
# of the target. Order is not important
aptsources=Debian
# the order of sections is not important.
# the bootstrap option determines which repository
# is used to calculate the list of Priority: required packages.
bootstrap=Debian

[Debian]
packages=
source=http://http.debian.net/debian
keyring=debian-archive-keyring
suite=stable

This will result in a completely normal bootstrap of Debian stable from
the specified mirror, for armel in /opt/multistrap/.

'Architecture' and 'directory' can be overridden on the command line.

Specify a package to extend the bootstap to include that package and
all dependencies. Dependencies will be calculated by apt so as to use
only the most recent suitable version from all configured repositories.

General settings:

'directory' specifies the top level directory where the bootstrap
will be created - it is not packed into a .tgz once complete.
