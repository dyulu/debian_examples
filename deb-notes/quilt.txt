# Quilt manages a stack of patches.
# Patches are applied incrementally on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches.

$ quilt --help
Usage: quilt [--trace[=verbose]] [--quiltrc=XX] command [-h] ...
       quilt --version
Commands are:
	add       fold    mail      refresh  snapshot
	annotate  fork    new       remove   top
	applied   graph   next      rename   unapplied
	delete    grep    patches   revert   upgrade
	diff      header  pop       series
	edit      import  previous  setup
	files     init    push      shell

Global options:

--trace
	Runs the command in bash trace mode (-x). For internal debugging.

--quiltrc file
	Use the specified configuration file instead of ~/.quiltrc (or
	/etc/quilt.quiltrc if ~/.quiltrc does not exist).  See the pdf
	documentation for details about its possible contents.  The
	special value "-" causes quilt not to read any configuration
	file.

--version
	Print the version number and exit immediately.

$ quilt add -h
Usage: quilt add [-P patch] {file} ...

Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.  Files must be
added to the patch before being modified.  Files that are modified by
patches already applied on top of the specified patch cannot be added.

-P patch
	Patch to add files to.

$ quilt push -h
Usage: quilt push [-afqvm] [--fuzz=N] [--merge[=merge|diff3]] [--leave-rejects] [--color[=always|auto|never]] [--refresh] [num|patch]

Apply patch(es) from the series file.  Without options, the next patch
in the series file is applied.  When a number is specified, apply the
specified number of patches.  When a patch name is specified, apply
all patches up to and including the specified patch.  Patch names may
include the patches/ prefix, which means that filename completion can
be used. The mtime of all touched files will be exactly the same to
prevent time skews.

-a	Apply all patches in the series file.
-q	Quiet operation.
-f	Force apply, even if the patch has rejects.
-v	Verbose operation.
--fuzz=N
	Set the maximum fuzz factor (default: 2).
-m, --merge[=merge|diff3]
	Merge the patch file into the original files (see patch(1)).
--leave-rejects
	Leave around the reject files patch produced, even if the patch
	is not actually applied.
--color[=always|auto|never]
	Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a tty).
--refresh
	Automatically refresh every patch after it was successfully applied.

$ quilt pop -h
Usage: quilt pop [-afRqv] [--refresh] [num|patch]

Remove patch(es) from the stack of applied patches.  Without options,
the topmost patch is removed.  When a number is specified, remove the
specified number of patches.  When a patch name is specified, remove
patches until the specified patch end up on top of the stack.  Patch
names may include the patches/ prefix, which means that filename
completion can be used.

-a	Remove all applied patches.
-f	Force remove. The state before the patch(es) were applied will
	be restored from backup files.
-R	Always verify if the patch removes cleanly; don't rely on
	timestamp checks.
-q	Quiet operation.
-v	Verbose operation.
--refresh
	Automatically refresh every patch before it gets unapplied.
